Simon Game Project to Learn Javascript
This game is just a beginner project to learn JAVASCRIPT.

In this game a circle is divided into four leds, the game will flash leds in random order.
The player has to remember the order and click the leds in the same order.
If the player clicks in the same order, the number of lights flashing will increase by one which is set to 1 by default.

If the player keeps on clicking the LEDs in the right order, and count reaches to 20. The player will win otherwise the player will loose.

The game has two modes:
1. Normal Mode
2. Strict Mode: If the player looses one the count is reset to 1.
